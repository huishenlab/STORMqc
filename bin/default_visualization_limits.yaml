# Default values for y-axis limits in platetools plots
#
# It is highly suggested that you do not modify this file, rather you should copy this file and then adjust values in
# the copied file. You can then run the make_pipeline_files.py with the -V|--visualize-config option to create pipeline
# files that point to the copied file instead.

# For each plot, there is a low ("lo") and a high ("hi") option that can be adjusted. Note, no values are checked for
# reasonableness, so it is up to the user to ensure the limits are reasonable.
